# Web Scrabing  & Linear Regression

<!-- The Goal of This Project is to Create module of linear Regression to compare laptop prices based on multiple features for customers needs and predict the Price.  -->
The goal of this project was to use Regression models to predict the Price of Laptops in Amazon to help People to have an idea How the features can change the price. We worked with data scrapped from Amazon by us, after refining a model, we predict a price of our own dataset to visualize and communicate results using regplot.
